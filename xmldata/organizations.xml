        <description>
            The Wheatland Chorale has earned a reputation as one of Pennsylvania's premier choral ensembles. The singers, 
            all volunteers, are selected through audition, and travel from throughout Central and Southeastern Pennsylvania 
            for weekly rehearsals in Lancaster. The Chorale is named for its birthplace in the Wheatland Hills area of Lancaster. 
            The popularity of the Wheatland Chorale has grown steadily. The regular season includes a concert subscription 
            series, performed in Lancaster, Wyomissing and at Elizabethtown College.

        <description>
            Now in its 66th season, the Lancaster Symphony Orchestra has played for over three decades under the direction of 
            Maestro Stephen Gunzenhauser. The Symphony has evolved from a community orchestra playing a few concerts per year 
            into a $1.7 million organization of professional musicians presenting six Classic Series concerts, the Sounds of 
            the Season holiday concert series and two New Year's Celebration concerts. The concerts feature international 
            guest artists and conductors and frequent U.S. and world premieres, such as 2012's national premiere of 
            Disney's Fantasia Live In Concert. Opening Night Friday audiences are also treated to a post-concert reception 
            where they can interact with the Symphony's musicians and guest artists.

        <description>
            OperaLancaster was founded as the Lancaster Opera Workshop in the early 50s in the small in-home studio of 
            Frederick Robinson and Dorothy Darr. Today, OperaLancaster is the only surviving opera company in Pennsylvania 
            between Philaldelphia and Pittsburg producing opera with full sets, costumes, and full orchestra every year.
            Each season, OperaLancaster offers three main stage productions: A light production in English in the Fall, 
            an annual production of Amahl &amp; the Night Visitors in January, and a traditional staged Grand Opera in the 
            Spring. Additionally, OperaLancaster produces and presents smaller concerts, productions, community outreach, 
            lectures, and educational series throughout the year.
